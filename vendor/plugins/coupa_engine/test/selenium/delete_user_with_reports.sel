There seems to be a bug in Selenium where the browserbot does not honor the return code of an action
after a confirmation. We are not able to test that the delete_user action redirects to the list action
so we manually open that page.

|clickAndWait|//img[@alt="Delete edgar"]|
|verifyConfirmation|The user edgar has 1 report who will be deleted as well. Are you sure you wish to delete the user edgar?|
|verifyText|flash_notice|User 'edgar' has been deleted.|
